# Changelog

## 1.2.1

- Fixed routines that start cleaning immediately, such as "vacuum and mop", doing nothing. The repeat count was sent in a form the vacuum rejects, and because that command runs just before the start command, the rejection aborted the routine before the vacuum was told to start. Reported on a G20S Ultra (`roborock.vacuum.a143`, firmware `02.52.78`).

## 1.2.0

- Added onboarding for vacuums that have never been on the Roborock cloud: choose **New vacuum** in the guided CLI or GUI. The server adopts the vacuum from its own onboarding traffic and adds it to the inventory as soon as it registers, with its model, product name, and product id taken from a built-in catalog of Roborock robot vacuums.
- Guided onboarding now shows when the server is calculating the public key, so you know to wait before starting the next pairing cycle.
- Fixed onboarding behind a reverse proxy or SNAT when the HTTP and MQTT client addresses differ.
- Fixed the advertised MQTT port when it differs from the listening port.
- Fixed explicit HTTPS ports for reverse proxies, including `--local-api` on `:443`.
- Deleting a routine in the Roborock app now persists.
- Existing settings, cloud imports, and recovered keys are retained when updating.

## 1.1.0

- Added V2 onboarding support, including automatic public-key recovery and multipart NC registration.
- Removed the obsolete V2 unsupported status from the dashboard and guided onboarding.
- Confirmed working on QRevo Edge 2 Set and Saros 20 Sonic. See the tested-vacuum list for firmware and certificate details.
- Fixed certificate renewal handling when acme.sh reports that renewal is not yet needed.
- Existing settings and recovered keys are retained when updating. The Beta add-on is currently unused; use the stable add-on for this release.

## 1.0.2

- Added external TLS support and basic reverse proxy support.
- Explicitly handle the unsupported `v2` `/region` flow so detection no longer falls through.
- Improved device id matching and routine resuming.

## 1.0.1

- Added support for the iOS app's `/v4/user/homes/{home_id}` home-data route so device lists no longer fall through to the generic catchall response.
- Protected `/v4/user/*` routes with the same Hawk authentication used by existing user API versions.

## 0.0.2-rc8

- Initial Home Assistant add-on manifest using the shared GHCR image.
